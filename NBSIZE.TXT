NBSIZE.EXE is a sample program that demonstrates a technique for resizing the
pages of a Notebook control when the size of the Notebook changes. This program
is comprised of 4 modules:

 NBSIZE.C:  Main module that provides Notebook functionality
 DIALOG.C:  Loads a dialog, associates it with a notebook page, and contains
            the dialog box window procedure as well as the dynamic sizing
            logic.
 CLIENT.C:  Creates a standard window and associates it with a notebook page.
            Processes the WM_PAINT message and uses a scalable font to display
            a string. The size of the font changes as the page is sized.
 MLE.C:     Creates an MLE control and associates it with a notebook page. It
            is automatically sized when the notebook page sizes.

All the pages rely on BKA_AUTOPAGESIZE to dynamically size their windows. The
three pages size themselves differently in response to the notebook getting
resized. The dialog box resizes its controls for optimum space. The client
window resizes its scalable font. The MLE resizes itself to the size of the
page.

I unfortunately did not have a lot of time to document this program but you
should be able to follow it if you have followed NBEZ.EXE or NBBASE.EXE.

I hope this program will be of some use.

GLOBAL HISTORY (KEPT SINCE 1/31/93 - Before that, kept on a per-module basis)

2-22-93 - Got rid of wasted space on the bottom of the notebook when no minor
          tabs were being used. Did this by setting the dimensions of the minor
          tabs to 0, 0. This based on a tip by Scott Kliger.
